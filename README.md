# Credit_Risk
## Overview
###
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning to analyze/determine credit card risk. To normalize the dataset, we will be using algorithms, such as Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Undersampling, Combination Under-Over Sampling, Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Adaboost Classifier.
## Result
### Naive Random Oversampling

- Balanced Accuracy: 0.6249984891886339
- Precision: The precision is low for High-risk loans and is high for Low-risk loans
- Recall: high(0.64) & low(0.66)
